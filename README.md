# Implementation-of-Bisecting-K-Means-and-K-Nearest-Neighbors

Through this project, the following two algorithms are implemented on the iris dataset in R language:
<ul> <li>bisecting K-Means. </li>
<li>K-Nearest Neighbors </li>
  </ul>

<b>Files:</b>

Run the code BKmeans_KNN.R to execute the program.
The BKmeans_KNN.R file executes both the algorithms and displays the results. 

<b> Requirements: </b>

The following packages are required to run the program:
<ul>
  <li>RColorBrewer</li>
<li>class</li>
<li>caret</li>
<li>lattice</li>
<li>ggplot2</li>
  </ul>
