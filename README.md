# Implementing-Bisecting-K-Means-and-K-Nearest-Neighbors-in-the-iris-dataset

Through this project, the following two algorithms are implemented on the iris dataset in R language:
<ul> <li>bisecting K-Means. </li>
<li>K-Nearest Neighbors </li>
  </ul>

In order to run the code download the main.R and BKmeans_KNN.R files into a single folder. 
Tha main.R file will call the BKmeans_KNN.R functions and execute both the algorithms and display the results. 

<b> Requirements: </b>
The following packages are required to run the program:
<ul>
  <li>RColorBrewer</li>
<li>class</li>
<li>caret</li>
<li>lattice</li>
<li>ggplot2</li>
  </ul>
